# Reminder

- We only have 24 hours.
- We **cannot** do it all.
- We need the absolute minimum of minimum viable products.
- Anything that isn't necessary should be reserved for a stretch goal and anything that can be automated (but will take a while to set up) should be done manually.

# Browsing

- The ability to look at a map and see pins of locations to study
  - Different colors or icons (anything we can do to differentiate them) will display the different properties of the location before needing to click on them
  - Clicking on a place

# Crowd Sourcing
